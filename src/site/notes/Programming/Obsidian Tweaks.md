The little icon that had been appearing next to my wiki style links is kind of annoying to me. I turned it off using by adding a file in the CSS snippets folder called: `linkClean.css` it had just the folllowing code:

```
.external-link {
  background-image: none;
  padding-right: 0px;
}
```

This removes the little image and the padding that was put in place to hold the image. Thanks to [dcb](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/dcb ) on the Obsidian forum for that one. It was kind of driving me nuts.
