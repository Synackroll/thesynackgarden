* Defacing

* Phishing
* Session Hijacking
	* Modern web apps utilize cookies to maintain a user's session throughout different browsing sessions.  Although this lets the user login only once, if a malicious user obtains the cookie, they may be able to gain logged-in access with the victim's user without knowing their credentials.  (i.e., hijack the session.)
