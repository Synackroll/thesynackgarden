*Threat modeling* is the process used to map out threats to a provider.

The most effective way to determine the client's threat model is to survey them.

* What is the scope of exposure to attacks?
* What is their economic significance?
* What is their political involvement?
* How are they linked to supply chains?
* Do they offer essential services?
* Are there incentives for criminal organizations to attack them?
