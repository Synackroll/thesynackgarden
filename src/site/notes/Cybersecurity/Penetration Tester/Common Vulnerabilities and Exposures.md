[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) is a publicly available catalog of security issues sponsored by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Each security issue has a unique CVE ID number assigned by the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). The purpose of creating a unique CVE ID number is to create a standardization for a vulnerability or exposure as a researcher identifies it. A CVE consists of critical information regarding a vulnerability or exposure, including a description and references about the issue. The information in a CVE allows an organization's IT team to understand how detrimental a problem could be to their environment.
