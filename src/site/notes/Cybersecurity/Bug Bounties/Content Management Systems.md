A powerful tool that helps build a website without the need to code everything from scratch or even know how to code. Most CMS's provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> functionality where users edit as though they're working on a word processor.

CMS have two key components:
- A Content Management Application (CMA) - the interface used to add and manage content.
- A content delivery application (CDA) - The backend that takes teh input entered into the CAM and assmbles the code inta a working, visually appealing website.

From a security standpoint we want the CMS to be well-maintained withperiodic updates and upgrades withsufficient built0in security settings to harden the website from attackers.
