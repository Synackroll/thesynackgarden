[[Cybersecurity/Bug Bounties/Cross-Site Scripting/Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\|XSS]] discovery can be as difficult as exploitation.

**Automated Discovery** can be done through web application [[vulnerability scanners\|vulnerability scanners]].  (Such as **Nessus, Burp Pro, or ZAP**).

Common open-source tools are [XSS Strike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike), [Brute XSS](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/BruteXSS), and [XSSer](https://github.com/epsylon/xsser).

Manual Discovery can be done by testing known payloads in input fields of the web target.

More effective is manual code review if possible.
