Our objective is to identify as much information from the following areas.

* Domans and Sub domains
	* Many Organizations will have forgotten domains and subdomains taht are exposed externally.
* IP Ranges
* Infrastructure
	* What are the [[Cybersecurity/Bug Bounty Hunter/technology stacks\|technology stacks]]?
	* Are there [[Cybersecurity/Bug Bounty Hunter/Content Management Systems\|Content Management Systems]] (CMS).
* Virtual Hosts
	* Enumerate all virtual hosts (which are similar to subdomains, but indicate that the organzation is hosting multiple applications on the same web server.)

Often broken up into:

*Passive Information Gathering* where we do not interact directly with the target.

*Active Information Gathering* where we act directly with the target.  We need to have the required authorization to test, otherwise we may be engaging in illegal activities.
