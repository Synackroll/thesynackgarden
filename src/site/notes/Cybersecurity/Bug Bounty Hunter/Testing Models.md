*Black Box* testing models the attack of an opportunistic attacker, done without knowledge of the tested target.

*Gray Box* testing is a more informed engagement.  It seeks to mimic a better-informed attacker.

*White Box* testing is done with as much information as possible about the inner workings of the environment.
