Ohm's law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrecial circuit.  Where E = voltage (Volts), I = Current (Amps), and R = Resistance (Ohms), Ohm's law is expressed as:

**E = I x R**

Note that you can solve for any other member of the equation using simple Algebra.
