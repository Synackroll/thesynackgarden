**Resistors** oppose the flow of current in a DC circuit.

Variable resistors known as **potentiometers** are often used as an adjustable volume control.  **Potentiometers** control the electrical parameter of resistance.

**Capacitors** consist of a conductive surface separated by an insulator.  They are used to store energy in an electric field.  This ability is called **capacitance** the unit of capacitance is the farad.

**Inductors** are small coils of wire that set up a magnetic field around the coil when current flows through the coil.  An inductor stores energy in a magnetic field.  The ability to do this is called inductance, and the unit of inductance is the **henry.**

**Diodes** are the most basic semiconductor component.  They consist of an **anode** and a **cathode**.  The **cathode** lead of the diode is often marked with a stripe.  The forward voltage drop of a diode is lower in some diode types than in others.

**Light-emitting diodes** or **LEDs** are a particulare type of diode.  When LEDs are forward biased, (i.e, when DC current flows through them in the forward direction) they emit visible light.

**Transistors** are designed to control current flow through them.  They have three leads, one of which is the control pin.  A current (in the case of a  bipolar junction transistor) or voltage (in the case of the field effect transistor) controls the current flow between the other two pins.
