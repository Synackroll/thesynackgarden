Resistors can be connected in **series** or **parallel**.  

When resistors are connected in series then the DC current will be the same throughout all components.

When reistors are connected in parralell they are both conected directly to the voltage source.  **The voltage that flows across the reistors will be the same.** The current that flows through the resistors will be equal only if the resistance of the resistors is equal.  Generally, the total current I will be equal to the I1 + ... + In where *n* is the total number of resistors in parallell.
