### Units and terms:

Current - The name for the flow of electrons in an electric circuit.  Measured in **Amperes** (represented by 'A').

Voltage - The electrical term for the forces that causes electron flow.  Represented with the letter 'E'.  Measured in **Volts**.

Resistance - Resistance opposes the flow of current in a circuit.  The higher the resistance the smaller the current for a given voltage.  We use 'R' to stand for resistance.  Resistance is measured in **Ohms** and we use the greek letter Omega (Î©) to stand for Ohms.  Resistance opposes all types of current: Direct, Alternating, and RF current.

Alternating Current - The type of current from a wall socket.  The voltage and current are constantly changing.  Current flows in positive direction when positive, negative direction when negative.  Alternating current has a **frequency**  that is measured in **Hertz (Hz)** which is measure of cycles per second.  1 Hz is one cycle per second. 

Direct Current - The type of current you get out of a battery.  Current flows in only one direction through the circuit.

Conductors - Form the connections between components of an electric circuit.  Typically metal wires are used because they condut electrical current well.  (i.e., they have low resistance.)  Copper is a common choice because it has good conductivity and costs less than silver or gold.

Insulators - Materials that do not conduct electricity well.  (i.e., they have a high resistance.)  **Glass** is a good electrical insulator.

The **farad** is the unit of capacitance.  There are 1 million picofarads in a microfarad.

**Resonance** occurs when the effects of capacitance and inductance in circuit are the same (and opposite), for a given frequency.
